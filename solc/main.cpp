/*
The equivalent of setlocale(LC_ALL, "C") is called before any user code is run.
If the user has an invalid environment setting then it is possible for the call
to set locale to fail, so there are only two possible actions, the first is to
throw a runtime exception and cause the program to quit (default behaviour),
or the second is to modify the environment to something sensible (least
surprising behaviour).

The follow code produces the least surprising behaviour. It will use the user
specified default locale if it is valid, and if not then it will modify the
environment the process is running in to use a sensible default. This also means
that users do not need to install language packs for their OS.
